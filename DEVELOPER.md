# Developer Information

To try the examples it might be easiest to build the complete jar with all
the dependencies like this:

mvn -P build-archives -DskipITs -DskipTests package

Further Information can be found in the Wiki: https://github.com/marquies/cot-java-rest-sdk/wiki

To run the integration tests you should now use 'mvn integration-test'
